Civic Issue Reporting System

Overview

The Civic Issue Reporting System is a digital platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens and local authorities. It enables users to report civic issues such as potholes, garbage accumulation, water leakage, streetlight failures, and other public infrastructure problems. The system promotes transparency, accountability, and faster resolution of civic complaints.

This system provides:
	•	A simple interface for citizens to report issues
	•	Real-time issue tracking
	•	A centralized dashboard for authorities to manage complaints
	•	Improved communication and transparency

  Note: This is the first prototype of our Civic Issue Reporting System
